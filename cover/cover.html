      <h2>My Career</h2>
        <p>With over a decade of experience designing, delivering, and managing high-quality learning programmes, I bring a strong blend of educational expertise, technical proficiency, and leadership experience that would contribute effectively to your team.</p>
        <p>In my current role as an Instructional Designer at Advarra, I have led the design and development of engaging, accessible, and instructionally sound learning materials using tools such as Articulate 360, Storyline, and Miro. I work collaboratively with cross-functional teams, translating complex concepts into clear, user-centred learning experiences. My integration of AI tools to enhance video content and workflow efficiency has supported project scalability and innovation.</p>
        <p>Previously, as Head of Teacher Training and Development at Atlas Language School, I managed and supported teams of over 30 educators, developed comprehensive CPD frameworks, and designed blended and asynchronous courses tailored to diverse learner needs. These experiences honed my skills in curriculum design, quality assurance, stakeholder communication, and strategic planning, all of which are transferable to a range of digital learning and training environments.</p>
        <p>My academic background—including a Master’s in Professional Development in Language Education and a Diploma in Digital Learning Design—reflects my commitment to evidence-based practice and continuous learning. I am currently enrolled in a Higher Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which strengthens my capacity to apply data-driven and adaptive learning principles in modern education contexts.</p>
        <p>I am enthusiastic about contributing to an organisation that values innovation, learner engagement, and continuous improvement. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience could support your goals in learning design and development.</p>
